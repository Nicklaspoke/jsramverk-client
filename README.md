## How to run the application

### prerequisites

-   nodejs version >= 12 (developed on version 14, but should work with the latest lts)

The easiest way to get the application up and running is to first use `npm i` to install all dependencies, after that use `npm start` to begin runnint the development server.
Once the server has started, it can be accessed on localhost:3000
